      <p>Blockchain is a way of keeping track of information that is secure, transparent, and decentralized. Imagine a big book that has a record of every transaction that has ever happened. This book is stored on many different computers all around the world, and each time a new transaction is made, all of the computers check to make sure it is accurate. This means that nobody can cheat or change the information without everyone else knowing. It is like a chain of blocks, and that is why it is called "blockchain."</p>

      <p>Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct presidential elections, and this is particularly true in the case of Kenya. By using a blockchain ledger to count the votes, the entire election process could become much more transparent and secure.</p>

<p>First and foremost, a blockchain ledger is essentially a digital record of transactions that is maintained and updated by a network of computers. This means that once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered or tampered with in any way, providing a level of security and trust that is not possible with traditional voting systems.</p>

<p>Additionally, a blockchain ledger would allow Kenyan citizens to view the results of the election in real-time, providing greater transparency and accountability. This would help to build confidence in the electoral process and ensure that the results accurately reflect the will of the people.</p>

<p>Furthermore, using a blockchain ledger would eliminate the need for manual vote counting, which is often subject to human error and can be slow and labor-intensive. By automating this process, we can ensure that the election results are released quickly and accurately.</p>

<p>Overall, the use of blockchain technology in presidential elections has the potential to significantly improve the electoral process in Kenya. By providing greater security, transparency, and efficiency, it can help to build trust and confidence in the electoral system and ensure that the results accurately reflect the will of the people.</p>
